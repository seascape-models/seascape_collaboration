# Risks and solutions

This document is designed to identify and document potential sources of problems to ensure that we are sufficiently prepared to deal with these problems should we run into them in the future. Note these are only the identified problems potentially feasible solutions and are not necessarily adequate solutions. Further not that the consequence and likelihood are further influenced by: the users expertise on the project, the size of the project, the structure of the project and current software in use. Thus, project risks should be considered within their individual context.

A general and important comment is **if the consequences could be moderate to extreme, and you do not feel like you do not have the expertise to resolve this issue yourself, step 1 should ALWAYS be ask for help from someone who has more experience. Otherwise, you might make matters worse.**

We base our ratings on the following risk assessment guideline

## Cloud contents is corrupted of deleted

This would be in the case that the files on a cloud based system stopped working. Probably, this is not a massive deal because you should be able to access a previous version on a file. The consequences could be worse if the corruption or deletion affected the contents of the "Shared" folder, because that isn't backed up on GitHub.

**Consequence** = Minor (2)

**Likelihood** = Likely (B)

#### Potential causes

* .git file being corrupted?
* delays in syncing
* One of the users deleting something accidentally

#### Mitigation strategies

**Currently implemented**

* Save frequently
* Back up files on active projects on you computer
* GitHub/.git have copies of scripts and many materials
* Make sure that you keep clean and well structured directories

**Potential**

* Save periodically on an external drive
* Periodically store important files not also backed up on GitHub

#### Course of action (help)

1. See if you can retrieve files locally offline first (without updating from the cloud).
2. Try to retrieve files from the cloud system
3. Contact other users if this repository is shared and see if they can retrieve
4. Contact the cloud system provider for help
5. See if you can identify why this corruption or loss occurred and mitigate the risk for next time.
6. Once resolved replace corrupted files with uncorrupted files
